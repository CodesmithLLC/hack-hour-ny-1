This was actually false, If there was one more 9 and one more 0 it would have hit the upper number limit and would have been true.


Which of these is/are false? if any? *

A
B	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AC

NaN is the only thing in javascript that isn't equal to itself


Which of these is/are false? if any? *

A	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
B	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AC
C	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AC

== will actually flatten an array and turn all values into a string separated by commas


What does this evaluate to? *

True	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	C
False	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
== will cause methods inside of an object to be evaluated and the returned value will coerce to a boolean


What does the final line do? *

Logs 0
Logs 1	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AC
Logs 2
Logs 3
Throws an error
Does nothing
Void actually works the same way as an iife would. So a closure is created at each value of i thats holds the actual value.


Which return false? *

A
B
C
D	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
None.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	C
converting any type of whitespace to a number turns it into the number 0


Which of these is true? *

A
B	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
C	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	C
None
Math.max() returns -Infinity because any value passed into it will always be greater than it. Math.min() does the opposite.


Which of these is true? *

A	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AC
B	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
C	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AC
None
True in a math operation will become 1 and false will become 0, but if it is not in a math operation it does not change values


What does the second line evaluate to? *

True	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	C
False	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
[0] == ![0]. [0] will first coerce to '0' which will then coerce to 0 which will then coerce to false. and ![0] is coerced to a boolean by the exclamation point making it false.


What do these evaluate to? *

"[object Object]", "[object Object][object Object]", "[object Object]", "false", 0, ""
0, "[object Object]", "[object Object]", "", "false", "[object Object][object Object]"	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	C
"[object Object][object Object]", 0, "[object Object]", "", "false", "[object Object]"
0, "[object, Object]", "false", "[object Object]", "[object Object][object Object]", ""	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	AX
Crazy type coercion
